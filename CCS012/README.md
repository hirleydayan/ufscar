This repository contains the result material of IoT post-graduation class ([PPGCCS](http://www.ppgccs.net)) from the
[Computer Science](http://www.ppgccs.net) discipline at [UFSCar](http://www.ufscar.br) university in Sorocaba, Brazil, in the first semester of 2017.

This material contains code, pdfs and references written and used during the classes.

In the classes students had the opportunity to explore IoT protocols and use
